        <h3>History of the Performing Arts festival</h3>
        <p>
            The Milan Festival of Performing Arts at Ippodromo of San Siro was born on August 10, 1913, with the first performance of Aida by the Milanese tenor Giovanni Zenatello and the theatre
            impresario Ottone Rovato to commemorate the centenary of the birth of Giuseppe Verdi. For over a hundred years (except
            for two short interruptions during the great wars) every summer the Milan Festival has become the largest open-air
            opera house in the world.
            <br>
            The current organizational structure is the result of the reform enshrined in Decree Law No. 134 of 1998 and Decree Law
            134 of 1998, which transformed the opera houses into private law foundations, thus creating the current Ippodromo of San Siro
            Foundation, and sanctioned the possibility of entry for private members. The current founding members of the Foundation
            are the Italian State, the Lombardia Region, the Municipality of Milan, the Province of Milan and the Chamber of
            Commerce, Industry, Crafts and Agriculture of Milan. In the past it was the CariMilan Foundation, the Banca Popolare
            di Milan and the Accademia Filarmonica di Milan.
